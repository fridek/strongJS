I was so annoyed by lack of strong types in JS, that I decided to fix it.
This library lets you define types of input arguments and call proper function.
It is designed to be quite transparent, once function is properly initialised user can call it in usual way, library will do the rest.

Early dev stage. Please check tests.js for usage.
